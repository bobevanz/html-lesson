	<h1>What I did before bootcamp</h1>
	<p>I was a car salesman at Northgate Chrysler,<br> it was a blast but the stress of the<br> job wasn't worth it.</p><br>
	<h2>Why I chose a bootcamp</h2>
	<p>Technology is evolving everyday, even menial jobs<br> are being pushed out from artificial intelligence.<br> I joined this bootcamp because I want to be in the know how<br> and in an industry theat will never die.</p><br>
	<h3>Where I want to work after bootcamp</h3>
	<p>Anywhere really, somewhere close preferrably.<br> But i'm willing to travel to the moon and back<br> if that's what it takes</p><br>
